# What is webpack?

Webpack is an open-source JavaScript module bundler. It is made primarily for JavaScript, but it can transform front-end assets such as HTML, CSS, and images if the corresponding loaders are included. webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.

> Running webpack without any configuration will search for `src` folder as module and inside that it will seach any of `src/index<.js, .json, .wasm>` files by default.
